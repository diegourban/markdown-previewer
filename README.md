## Requirements
- `http-server` - Some browsers (e.g. Chrome) will fail to load the file unless it’s served via HTTP, which means that you’ll need a server to view your page.

## Installation
`npm install -g http-server` - to install http-server in global mode

## Usage
`http-server` - to start the server (from project root directory)

`http://localhost:8080` - to open the page
